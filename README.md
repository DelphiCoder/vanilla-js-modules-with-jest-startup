# vanilla-js-modules-with-jest-startup
Vanilla JavaScript skeleton with Jest support for ESM modules.

## Description

This is a simple startup skeleton for a vanilla JavaScript project with **Jest testing that supports ES6 modules (ESM)**.

This skeleton creates an easier way to deal with ESM modules when using Jest for testing within a Vanilla JavaScript Application.

It doesn't use the convoluted hacks or experimental settings such as `--experimental-vm-modules`. **It just works!**

**Note:** No compiler is used here. Just raw JavaScript files.  The one Babel library is merely used to help Jest deal with ES6 modules.

Current as of December 2023.
